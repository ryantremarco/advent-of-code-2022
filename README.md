# It's Advent!
This repo is the home of all the code I'll be using to complete [2022's Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

I'll be writing it in [Go](https://go.dev/) again this year because I think it's neat.
If you're thinking of learning Go yourself, I highly recommend the [Learn Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/) Gitbook.

## My own goal
The aim this year is, primarily, to actually complete all of the puzzles.
Aside from that though, I'm trying to lean into using Go's generics as much as is practical in order to get a better feel for them.
Because of that, a few of my solutions might be a little more convoluted than they need to be -- I'm not aiming for succinctness here.
