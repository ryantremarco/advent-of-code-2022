# It's Advent!
This repo is the home of all the code I'll be using to complete [2022's Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

I'll be writing it in [Go](https://go.dev/) again this year because I think it's neat.
If you're thinking of learning Go yourself, I highly recommend the [Learn Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/) Gitbook.
